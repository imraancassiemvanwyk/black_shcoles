# black_scholes
The BSM model is often used to price european options because it has an analytical solution so unlike many other methods for pricing
these  financial derivatives the paramters for the option can justbe plugged into a formula.

This implementation of trhe black scholes model is relatively simple to use by creating an object of the class
and setting parameters of the instance you created then just calling the functions of which values you want which include:
 call price 
,put price 
,delta
,gamma
,rho
,vega
 and theta
